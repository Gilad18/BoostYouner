# Project Title
 
BoostYooner Web Application
 
## Getting Started
 
Appleseed Bootcamp MidProject with a full front-end deployment.
 
I had one week to create a full design web app with React js to showcase my development skills. 
My inspiration for this project was a Media Buying platform (DSP) to let any businesses the
technology for self-servef influencer marketing.
 
## Overview
 
After a user has opened his Bosstyooner account, he/she can create a new ad campaign by filling
their targeting needs in order to find them a relevant match.
the user can view pricing, a preview of the ad, partner's details, and an option to complete the acquisition
of request for acertian influencer and increase thier business social exposure.
Once the transaction was approved, the user can view dinamic statistic on the dashboard.
 
## Project timeline 
 
1. Creating and Editing a REST mock-API with a database of the influences
2. Bulding the app Routes with React-Router-DOM
3. Working on the the main functions of the app (new campaign, finding a match, local storage, etc ...)
3. Working on more complexed function of the app (getting Statistics, updating the Dashboard, etc ..)
4. Design and style with CSS
5. Inserting more content to the app (blogs with news API, landing page and about us section)
6. Adding more features to the app (Deposit, Balance, Campaign History Table, more advanced statistic)
7. Improving Styling and Visibility
9. Code Clean-Up

## Technologies Used
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript (ES6)
* GitHub
* React
* Webpack
* Axios
* Mock API

## Wins and Blockers
 
I manage to have most of the functionality I wanted for this app to have a full  user experience and if this project
one day become real all it needed is to simply connect the influences(aka partners) to Instagram API and to automatically
upload the content from Boostyooner app.
 
I did want to have more data statistic on the dashboard with a combination of chart and graph and to style it 
in a more modern way
