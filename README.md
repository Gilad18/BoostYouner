# Project Title
 
BoostYooner ;
 
React JS & CSS
 
## Getting Started
 
Appleseed Bootcamp MidProject with a full front-end deployment.
 
I had one week to create a full design web app with React js to show my development skill
 
My inspiration for this project was a Media Buying platform(DSP) to let any  businesses the
technology to self-served influencer marketing with relevant partners
 
### Making a Progressive Web App
 
After a user has opened his Bosstyooner account, he/she can create a new ad campaign by filling
their targeting needs and our app will find them a relevant match.
the user can view pricing, a preview of the ad, partner's details, and an option to complete the acquisition
of request for the influencer posting the ad to increase the business social exposure.
once the transaction was approved, he can see the statistic on his dashboard
 
## Stages 
 
1. Creating and Editing a  REST mock-API with a database of the influences
2. Creating the app Routes with React-Router-DOM
3. Creating the main functions of the app (new campaign, finding a match, local storage, etc ...)
3. Creating the complex function of the app (getting Statistics, updating the Dashboard, etc ..)
4. Design and style with CSS
5. Inserting more content to the app (blogs with news API, landing page and about us section)
6. Adding more features to the app (Deposit, Balance, Campaign History Table, more advanced statistic)
7. Improving Styling
9. Code Clean-Up
 
## Wanted/GotIT
 
I manage to have most of the functionality I wanted for this app to have a full  user experience and if this project
one day become real all it needed is to simply connect the influences(aka partners) to Instagram API and to automatically
upload the content for Boostyooner.
 
I did want to have more data statistic on the dashboard with a combination of chart and graph and to style it 
in a more modern way
